<p>In this assignment, you'll setup a se</p>
<p></p>
<div>
<p><strong>Step I:&nbsp;</strong>Setup your aws LAMP Ubuntu server</p>
<p>For this task, follow Setting up an "AWS EC2 Instance with LAMP and GIT" tutorial on BeachBoard (<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=414161&amp;type=discuss&amp;rcode=CSULB-1484791" target="_self">Useful links</a>) . DigitalOcean is OK too but AWS is recommended. Make sure you can SSH to your LAMP server. Make sure you can pull changes from your github repository on your server.</p>
<p>You can use Node as your web server engine instead of&nbsp;Apache or nginx.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p>Next, get a free domain (register with namecheap using your .edu email). In your DNS records, make sure your domain points to your aws instance. Make sure all is good and "It works".</p>
<p>You will demonstrate that your server is up and running and you can pull your github repo from your sever. The deadline for this step will be determined in class.</p>
<p><strong></strong></p>
<p><strong>Step&nbsp;II</strong>: A simple HTTPS Server (separate deadline from the above step)</p>
<p>By now, you have a simple HTTP server that runs on either Apache or Node.</p>
<div>
<p>Next, use "<strong>Let's Encrypt</strong>" to setup a free certificate (all instructions on&nbsp;<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>). Test your TLS configuration with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSL Labs.</a>&nbsp; Take a look at the "SSL Config" tutorial on Useful links (<a href="/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=414161&amp;type=discuss&amp;rcode=CSULB-1484791" target="_self">Useful links</a>, for Apache).</p>
<p>You will be graded based on your SSL Labs performance. Make sure to follow the feedback that you receive from SSL Labs and you receive an "A+" grade from their tests.</p>
