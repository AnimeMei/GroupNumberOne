In this assignment, you'll setup a sever

Step I: Setup your aws LAMP Ubuntu server

For this task, follow Setting up an "AWS EC2 Instance with LAMP and GIT" tutorial on BeachBoard (Useful links) . DigitalOcean is OK too but AWS is recommended. Make sure you can SSH to your LAMP server. Make sure you can pull changes from your github repository on your server.

You can use Node as your web server engine instead of Apache or nginx. 

Next, get a free domain (register with namecheap using your .edu email). In your DNS records, make sure your domain points to your aws instance. Make sure all is good and "It works".

You will demonstrate that your server is up and running and you can pull your github repo from your sever. The deadline for this step will be determined in class.



Step II: A simple HTTPS Server (separate deadline from the above step)

By now, you have a simple HTTP server that runs on either Apache or Node.

Next, use "Let's Encrypt" to setup a free certificate (all instructions on Let's Encrypt). Test your TLS configuration with SSL Labs.  Take a look at the "SSL Config" tutorial on Useful links (Useful links, for Apache).

You will be graded based on your SSL Labs performance. Make sure to follow the feedback that you receive from SSL Labs and you receive an "A+" grade from their tests.
