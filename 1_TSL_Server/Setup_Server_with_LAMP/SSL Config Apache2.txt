The instructions below are intended for Apache. NGINX and Node are slightly different.

Run SSL Labs on your domain to check your config and report your observations to class.
 
You want your ssl config file to include these lines:
 
LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so

<IfModule mod_ssl.c>
 
SSLEngine on
SSLProtocol -all +TLSv1.2
# "whenever TLSv1.3 comes along you'll need to update your OpenSSL and Apache and change 1.2 to the newer version"
 
SSLHonorCipherOrder On

SSLCipherSuite ECDHE-ECDSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-CBC-SHA384:ECDHE-RSA-AES256-CBC-SHA256:ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:DHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384:!aNULL:!MD5:!DSS
 
**************************************************
Your httpd.conf config file would have

<VirtualHost *:443>

ServerName NAME.name
ServerAlias www.NAME.name
 Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains"

# the above is to enable HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS). That age is 2 years in seconds (2*365*24*60*60) which is OK for your project duration. 

SSLEngine on
SSLCertificateFile    PATH-TO-cert.pem-FILE
SSLCertificateKeyFile PATH-TO-privkey.pem-FILE
SSLCertificateChainFile PATH-TO-fullchain.pem-FILE 

# Note that Name.name is an example for your domain and all PATH-* are file paths. Change them accordingly
</VirtualHost>

To force a redirect to HTTPS from HTTP include the below in your configuration:

<VirtualHost *:80> 
ServerName Name.name
  Redirect permanent / https://Name.name/
</VirtualHost>
